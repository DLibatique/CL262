## Course Objectives
This course will put into practice the grammatical knowledge that you have acquired through the first three semesters of the Ancient Greek language sequence in reading the first major work of Greek literature, Homerâ€™s *Iliad*. By reading selected passages, we will build your Greek vocabulary, fortify your knowledge of Greek forms and syntax, and develop your translation skills. By reading about 50-80 lines of Greek per class and the rest of the poem in translation, we will also learn about poetic meter and Homeric style.
